download the repo by clicking the green "code" button, then "download as zip". go to "chrome://extensions", toggle "developer mode" on in the top right, click "load unpacked", go to the directory you downloaded this repo to, and select the "src" folder. Now you should be able to go to any hypixel page (reload it first) and have it automatically convert to 24 hour time.
